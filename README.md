#Netrunner Adventure Game

This project is a browser based text adventure game that I made for the purposes of learning more Javascript and object oriented programming concepts

I made this as part of The Developer Academy Bootcamp.

It is a personal project made with relatively little programming knowledge over the course of a few days. Plz be kind!
